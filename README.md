Hello 👋, I'm Mesut. I am a Software Engineer. I love design patterns and clean code in
every possible way. I have been a developer in all aspects for about 7 years. I am primarily experienced in Back-End Development, but I can also
manage complete Front-End application development steps. I speak Turkish and English, and I am currently trying to improve my Spanish skills.
